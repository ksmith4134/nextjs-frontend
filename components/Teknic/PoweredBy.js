            <h3 className='text-xl font-bold mt-4'>Innovative Performance</h3>
            <p className='mt-2'>Automation is often one of the areas with the most potential to excel for machine performance and marketability. Better performance and reliability are two of the most tangible advantages and Teknic has numerous proprietary features that directly address these goals. For example, the g-Stopâ„¢ anti-resonance motion algorithm reduces machine vibration and ringing while simultaneously allowing faster motion.</p>

Teknic's focus on quality gives us the confidence to offer a 3+ year warranty on all of our servo motors, controls, drives, and power supplies.</p>
